Filter tags help users track and confirm which filters have been applied when they are sorting through a list or table of results. Since tags are generated by applying filters, they also create another mechanism by which users can remove applied filters.

Tags arenâ€™t removable when they apply strict limits to the data being viewed, such as
- one two-year period of time per search
- a persistent toggle, like processed/raw data
