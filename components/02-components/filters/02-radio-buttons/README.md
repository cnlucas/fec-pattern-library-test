Radio buttons allow users to select exactly one option from a visible list.

## When to use
- When users need to select only one option out of a set of mutually exclusive choices.
- When the number of available options can fit onto a mobile screen.

## When to consider something else
- Consider checkboxes if users need to select more than one option or if there is only one item to select.
- Consider a dropdown if you don’t have enough space to list out all available options.
- If users should be able to select zero of the options.

### Guidance from the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/#radio-buttons)
> - Users should be able to tap on or click on either the text “label” or the radio button to select or deselect an option.
> - Options that are listed vertically are easier to read than those that are listed horizontally. Horizontal listings can make it difficult to tell which label pertains to which radio button.
> - Use caution if you decide to set a default value. Setting a default value can discourage users from making conscious decisions, seem pushy, or alienate users who don’t fit into your assumptions. If you are unsure, leave nothing selected by default.
