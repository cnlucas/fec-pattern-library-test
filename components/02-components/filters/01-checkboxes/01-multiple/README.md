Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a visible list.

## When to use
- When a user can select any number of choices from a set list.
- When a user needs to choose “yes” or “no” on only one option (use a stand-alone checkbox). For example, to toggle a setting on or off.
- When users need to see all the available options at a glance.

## When to consider something else
- If there are too many options to display on a mobile screen.
- If a user can only select one option from a list (use radio buttons instead).

### Guidance from the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/#checkboxes)
> - Users should be able to tap on or click on either the text label or the checkbox to select or deselect an option.
> - List options vertically if possible; horizontal listings can make it difficult to tell which label pertains to which checkbox.
> - Avoid using negative language in labels as they can be counterintuitive. For example, “I want to receive a promotional email” instead of “I don’t want to receive promotional email.”
> - Make sure selections are adequately spaced for touch screens.
