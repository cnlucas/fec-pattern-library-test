Feeds or lists of items are split into multiple pages because very long collections are more than a user can scan or comprehend.

Feed pagination controls allow users to know how many pages of items exist. They allow users to navigate forward and backward one page at a time, and to always be able to select the first and last page from the list.

## When to use
- In combination with feeds, lists, or [chart table](/components/detail/chart-table) components, when the number of items is countable without making the page less performant

## When to consider something else
- When the number of items is not easily counted without impacting performance, such as in a data table or legal resource table, use [data pagination](/components/detail/data-pagination)

## Status
This component is not currently in use on the site, but the styles have been coded and it is ready to try out in usability testing.
