A reaction box prompts users to give feedback about a specific new feature in the context of the production site.

## When to use
- When a feature is experimental, and hypotheses about its usefulness need to be tested in production
- If a feature has undergone usability testing, but requires additional validation with a wider general audience

## Guidance
- Reaction boxes are not replacements for usability testing, but can measure general feedback from a wider audience
