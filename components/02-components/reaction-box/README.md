A reaction box prompts users to give feedback about a specific new feature in the context of the production site.

## When to use
- When a feature is experimental, and hypotheses about its usefulness need to be tested in production
- If a feature has undergone usability testing, but requires additional validation with a wider general audience

## Guidance
- Reaction boxes are not replacements for usability testing, but can measure general feedback from a wider audience

## Status
This component is not currently in use on the site. Previously, we used reaction boxes to collect feedback on the new interactive charts and graph components in the data section. We've kept it in the pattern library because there could be a similar use case for a new feature in the future.
