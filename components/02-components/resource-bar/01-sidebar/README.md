Resource bars help users identify the most important or most commonly-sought FEC content of the same page type that’s related to the topic of the page they’re on. Sidebars are user for short lists, and appear on the right-hand side of the main content.

## When to use
- When there is a preceding or subsequent page of the same type about the same topic

## When to consider something else
- When the list of resources is longer than the page’s main content. Either a standalone page for this topic isn’t needed, or the links should be written into the main page content
- When the page is a different type of page or publication about a related topic, list them underneath the sidebar container</br>
_Ex: Record articles related to content on [a guide page](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/filing-reports/quarterly-reports/) appear as a list under the sidebar_
