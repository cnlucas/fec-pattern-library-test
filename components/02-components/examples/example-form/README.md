The example form component creates a visual target for users to recognize when a sample of a properly completed, multiple-page form is available. The thumbnail and document title should link to the full-size form.

Example components are stylistically similar to the [blockquote](/docs/typography) typography style, since both indicate a small pause in the main content for an illustrative sample or quotation.

## When to use
- Users need sample content that spans multiple pages or an entire completed form

## When to consider something else
- If users need only a specific example for a small section of a form, use an [example image](/components/detail/example-image) with a short excerpt from the form
