The example paragraph component displays a text-based sample scenario. Example paragraphs give users relatable samples that illustrate complex concepts. They can accommodate complex styling, like lists and headers.

Example components are stylistically similar to the [blockquote](/docs/typography) typography style, since both indicate a small pause in the main content for an illustrative sample or quotation.

## When to use
- Users need a short, specific scenario to help them understand a concept

## When to consider something else
- If a longer, more detailed scenario is required, consider creating a full example scenario page using the [Reporting example](/docs/page-layouts/reporting-example-page) page template in Wagtail
