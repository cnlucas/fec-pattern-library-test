      If a candidate makes a noncampaign speech at a civic association luncheon and, on the way out, chats with a few attendees about his campaign in response to their questions, the conversation does not convert the appearance into a campaign-related event. On the other hand, if a candidate flew into a city for a trip that involved both personal vacation days and days spent campaigning, an incremental approach to paying for the trip would be required, to avoid the campaign paying the lodging, subsistence and sightseeing expenses on the vacation days â€” an expense that would be considered an <a href="#">impermissible personal use of campaign funds</a>. Because of the non-incidental nature of the campaign days, the airfare would be considered a campaign-related expense.
