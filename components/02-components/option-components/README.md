Option components are typically assembled from at least a ruled heading and a following short paragraph. Often, they are used with a button or some other primary action, and a sidebar. Use more than one option component in a row to give an introduction that helps users disambiguate between topics with much more detailed information on a following page.

## When to use
- Users need a preview of their options for information before starting or committing to a deep dive into detailed subject matter

## When to consider something else
- When users only need a brief amount of detail before making their choice, or when the options are a prioritized set of the whole array available, consider a card
