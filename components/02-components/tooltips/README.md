Tooltips contain contextual annotations or helper text on demand when a user hovers or focuses on an element, usually in informational icon.

## When to use
- When a setting or control is highly specific to the FEC’s unique subject matter or context </br>
_Ex: The “[Restrict contributions](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&two_year_transaction_period=2018&min_date=01%2F01%2F2017&max_date=03%2F02%2F2018)” filter_

## When to consider something else
- If users needs to refer back to the content frequently, or the content is critical to understanding functionality or context, consider making the annotation part of the constant interface

## Guidance
- Keep the content short and direct
- If you find yourself writing copy that explains how to use the interface, evaluate whether you have actually solved the original design problem in a user-centered way. Tooltip content should not contain instructions for how to use an interface. Conduct usability testing to better understand the problems with the interface’s design.
