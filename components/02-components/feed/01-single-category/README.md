Feeds display single posts chronologically, with the most recent posts appearing first. Feeds that show posts from one content category should be visually simple, and eliminate metadata fields that arenâ€™t needed to tell one type of content from another.

## When to use
- To display a short-medium length list of posts from one content or publication category

## When to consider something else
- If the list of items is long (more than 7-10) consider using pagination within the feed or another type of interaction altogether
- If the date of publication is irrelevant to the content or to users' needs, a long feed organized by date may be frustrating. Consider methods that order items by how frequently they are used.

### Examples
- [Recent advisory opinions issued feed](https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/advisory-opinions/)
- [Commission directives and policies](https://www.fec.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/)
