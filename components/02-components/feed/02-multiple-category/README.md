Feeds display single posts chronologically, with the most recent posts appearing first. Feeds that show posts from multiple content categories can display more metadata elements, such as category tags or sub-category labels, which help people identify the differences.

## When to use
- When users are browsing a list of items from more than one content or publication category, and the most recent content is more likely to be of interest than older items
- Help users navigate between types of content by providing basic category or keyword filtering

## When to consider something else
- If the date of publication is irrelevant to the content or to users' needs, a long feed organized by date may be frustrating. Consider methods that order items by how frequently they are used.

### Examples
- [Latest updates feed](https://www.fec.gov/updates/)
- Reports about the FEC: [Strategy, budget and performance category](https://www.fec.gov/about/reports-about-fec/strategy-budget-and-performance/)
