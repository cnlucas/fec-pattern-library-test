Slabs are full screen-width containers with a solid background color. Any type of content can be placed within a slab—there is no set structure for what’s inside.

## When to use
- As a visual device to create a strong visual break or separation between different types of page content
- Toward the bottom of the page, with a `.neutral` background to create a separate space for related articles, resources, or legal disclaimers
