Icon headings allow text to be indented by an image, which aligns the text with the top edge of the image. The image and text will be visually grouped, and the text will never wrap around or under the icon when responding to different screen sizes.

## When to use
- When icons can be helpful way to recall a specific type of content, or a particular topic</br>
_Ex: Headlines on raising (or spending) [breakdown pages](https://www.fec.gov/data/raising/)_
- When you need to call more visual attention to a headline
- When you need to group text with a specific image</br>
_Ex: Commissioner biography [thumbnails](https://www.fec.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/commissioners/)_
- When you need to create a soft visual break in the reading experience of a page

## When to consider something else
- If the layout is already busy or cluttered, use a plain text headline instead
- If you need to create a stronger visual break in the reading experience of a page, you may want to consider using a full-width slab container and a plain text headline
