Committee status indicators provide users with a quick way to determine whether a committee is active or terminated. These indicators appear on committee profile pages and reflect the committee’s status for each two-year period. They also appear in the global search and provide one quick way for users to distinguish between two similarly named committees.
 
### When to use
- Users need to determine a committee’s active or terminated status.
- Space is limited.
 
### When to consider something else
- If the user needs in depth information about the committee's creation or termination date, or other information about why the committee was terminated.
