Validation messages are displayed **after** a user has interacted with a particular field. Error validations help users learn that their choices were not applied, either because their entries were incompatible with what the field accepts, or because of a site error.

## When to use
- When a user's intended action has not been applied
- When a user's entry to a field or selection has not been accepted by the system

## When to consider something else
- Validation styles should not be used to describe the limitations or behavior of the filter. If a filter needs more context, consider using a persistent message outside of the field, or a tooltip.
