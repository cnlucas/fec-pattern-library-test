Messages keep users informed of important and sometimes time-sensitive changes.

## When to use
- The user has reached a dead end through their navigation—either they’ve entered a search which returns no results, or there is no data available in this entry. Offer users navigational assistance to get them back on the main trail.

## Guidance
- Be careful not to treat this like an error. It’s the site that has functioned in an unexpected way, not an error on the user’s part.
