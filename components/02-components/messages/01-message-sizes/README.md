Messages keep users informed of important and sometimes time-sensitive changes.

## When to use

#### Big
- When a whole page is impacted by the change, and the message is the only page content. For example, the 404 or 500 error pages.

#### Standard
- When the message is long, complex, or needs to offer the user instructions for how to continue on after the message

#### Small
- When the message needs to appear in a small space within the layout and does not need a title or complex text structure

#### Mini
- When the message needs to appear in a very small space within the layout
- When you need to use a message as an element within a layout that’s always present, instead of one that appears briefly</br>
_Ex: Time-sensitive events being promoted on the [home page](https://www.fec.gov/)_</br>
_Ex: Export warnings on [data tables](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts)_

### Guidance from the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/alerts/)
> - When the user is required to do something in response to an alert, let them know what they need to do and make that task as easy as possible. Think about how much context to provide with your message. For example, a notification of a system change may require more contextual information than a validation message. Write the message in concise, human readable language; avoid jargon and computer code.
> - Be polite in error messages — don’t place blame on the user.
> - Users generally won’t read documentation but will read a message that helps them resolve an error; include some educational material in your error message.
> - But don’t overdo it — too many notifications will either overwhelm or annoy the user and are likely to be ignored.
> - Allow a user to dismiss a notification wherever appropriate.
> - Don’t include notifications that aren’t related to the user’s current goal.
