Messages keep users informed of important and sometimes time-sensitive changes.

## When to use

#### Big
- When a whole page is impacted by the change, and the message is the only page content. For example, the 404 or 500 error pages.

#### Standard
- When the message is long, complex, or needs to offer the user instructions for how to continue on after the message

#### Small
- When the message needs to appear in a small space within the layout and does not need a title or complex text structure

#### Mini
- When the message needs to appear in a very small space within the layout
- When you need to use a message as an element within a layout thatâ€™s always present, instead of one that appears briefly</br>
