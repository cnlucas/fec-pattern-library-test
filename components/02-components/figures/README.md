Figures are styles for combinations of labels and numbers. Labels can be either inline or above the numbers. Zero-padding with decimals is handled by JavaScript.

## When to use
- When users are comparing a short list of figures (five or fewer)
- When the layout needs a more stylized display that highlights an interesting set of data

## When to consider something else
- If there are more than five figures to compare, display the information in a table
