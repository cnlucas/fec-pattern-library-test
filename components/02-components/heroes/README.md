Hero slabs are built of a main text area and a sliver of an image. The background color should be either `.primary` or `.secondary` to keep an association between color and site navigation. The image should be more expressive and abstract in style than representational, but should evoke the subject matter of the section. Images may often need to be constructed to fit the context through editing, collaging, or blurring in order to meet these criteria.

Existing color associations:
- Campaign finance data: `.primary`
- Help for candidates and committees: `.secondary`
- Legal resources: `.primary`
- About: `.secondary`
- Press: `.secondary`
