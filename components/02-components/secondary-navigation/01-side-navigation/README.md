A hierarchical vertical navigation on the left side of a page that helps users navigate between pages within a section of the website.

## When to use
- When users are deciding between grouped pages of content within one section of the website
- To display a navigational hierarchy with one to two levels. If three levels are needed, the styles for the third level will need to be designed in the future.
- To display the “sub-navigation” within a section of the website

## When to consider something else
- If the content within each page is very short, consider using one medium-longer length page and using a sticky side nav component instead.

## Guidance
- Indicate where a user is within the navigational hierarchy. Use the “active” state to show users which page they have navigated to.
- Keep the navigation links short. They can be shorter derivatives of page titles themselves.
- If the navigation hierarchy is too long, users may miss items at the bottom. If it’s too deep, users may miss items that require too many clicks. Usability test to find the right balance between breadth and depth.
