A vertical navigation on the left side that helps users scan the contents of a page and jump between different sections. On desktop, the navigation sticks to remain in view as the user navigates.

## When to use
- Users need to navigate up and down longer sections of content on a single page
- Users need a way to scan the contents of a long page

## When to consider something else
- If a page is very long or has multiple levels of hierarchy, consider breaking the content into multiple pages and using a side navigation component to navigate between the pages
