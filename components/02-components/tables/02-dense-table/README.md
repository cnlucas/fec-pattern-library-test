Dense tables use more compact cell spacing and smaller text sizes.

The  `display` modifier class adds alternating background colors and more padding between the cell content and the top/bottom cell borders. 

## When to use
- For tables of [contribution limit data](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits-candidates/)
- When the table of information is very long and inappropriate to break up by pagination
- For long reference tables where sorting and filtering is unavailable
