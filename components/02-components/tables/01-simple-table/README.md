Simple tables are the standard table styling component. They create a bold row header and basic text entries.

The `display` modifier class adds vertical rules, alternating background colors, and more padding between the cell content and the top/bottom cell borders. Simple tables with display modifiers are visually similar to `.datatables` and are most commonly used for legal resources search results lists, which present legal case results in a format thatâ€™s visually consistent with filtered data results.

## When to use
- When a collection of information requires vertical alignment through columns for quick scanning and discovery of information

## When to consider something else
- If you need a row header and a column header, or if you need to present financial data, consider the [custom table component](/components/detail/custom-table)
