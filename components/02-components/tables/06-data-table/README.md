Data tables provide customizable views of tabular data. A unique feature of data tables is that columns can be sorted by one category at a time. The most common sorting model is set by default. Data tables can also include an expandable panel for more granular information.

Data tables are used for filterable [campaign finance data](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/president/), and for [legal resource case data](https://www.fec.gov/data/legal/advisory-opinions/2017-10/).
