Cards act as an entry point to finding more detailed information. They are intended to act as a high visual hierarchy link, and should appear and act clickable.

## When to use
- To display collections of content that are of similar, (but not the same) type

## When to consider something else
- Use a list if the design presents homogeneous content that is less than a few lines. This allows for faster scanning.
- Use a [callout component](/components/detail/callout) if the design presents multiple links, and only one card

## Guidance
- A card should be a singular link or provide a limited set of actions
- Keep the content short and direct
- Avoid inline links, except if the card uses the `card--wide` style, which allows for complex text structure. In this case, the card title should be the main entry point link. If necessary, there could be secondary, more specific inline links in the the copy below the card title.
