Cards act as an entry point to finding more detailed information. They are intended to act as a high visual hierarchy link, and should appear and act clickable. A card should be a singular link or provide a limited set of actions, so avoid inline links.

## When to use
- To display collections of content that are of similar, (but not the same) type

## When to consider something else
- Use a list if the design presents homogeneous content that is less than a few lines. This allows for faster scanning.
- Use a [callout component](/components/detail/callout) if the design presents multiple links, and only one card
